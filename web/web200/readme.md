# Web 200 - Manele
So there's this cool admin guy who has an awesome API: https://web200.dctf-finals16.def.camp/
We'd really want to use it ourselves but he doesn't respond to any of our emails - perhaps he doesn't like us...

We found out that he also he is a fan of a weird gipsy music that a lot of people love to hate. Yes, he's weird like that.

He even setup up a website where people can send him new hits, maybe it will help: https://manele.web200.dctf-finals16.def.camp/
